TODO:

- modify edit/save button so that it shows in browser the final crossword.js file, with the filler-word "definition"; the user just has to edit the definitions and send the finalized file to a mastodon bot.
- program a python mastodon bot (on lully) to publish the file and add it to the main index.hhtml
- host everything on lully
